# CyberChef-Recipes

I made this repository because I was tired of losing my recipes when switching
between devices.

## Usage

1. Copy the JSON of the recipe you want to use.
2. Go to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).
3. Click on the Load Recipe icon.
4. Paste the JSON into the Recipe textbox.
5. Click the Load button.

## TODO

- [ ] Organization of repository.
- [ ] Create indexes for recipes in each subfolder for easier navigation and to
provide descriptions of recipes.
- [ ] Collect all of my recipes scattered across my machines and installs...
